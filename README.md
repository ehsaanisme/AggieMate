## How It Works

AggieMate injects functionality directly into UC Davis Schedule Builder:

1. **DOM Detection** ‚Äì Observes page content and identifies course + instructor data  
2. **Export Button** ‚Äì Lets you set the start date of the quarter and instantly download your `.ics` file  
3. **Professor Ratings** ‚Äì Fetches public RMP data via background script and displays in clean, color-coded cards  
4. **UX Polish** ‚Äì Adds full-screen loading overlays, toggles, and native-feeling UI
